description: This classic short story from sci-fi luminary Harry Harrison offers a
  sympathetic glimpse into the inner lives of robots. In the future, society has grown
  ever more dependent on these super-intelligent machines, but despite their increasing
  autonomy, robots are still looked down on as second-class citizens. "The Velvet
  Glove" is a thought-provoking reversal of the conventional take on the issue of
  robots.
